Cheems OS Arch is a distribution of the original Cheems OS, just very modified. If i would recommend which distribution to start with its probably this one (for now).
Also you will probably be able to tell but this batch OS is heavily inspired off of Arch Linux.

Dependancies:
====================

Python 3.0 or later
Batch [pre installed on windows]
Visual Basic Scripts [pre installed on windows]
